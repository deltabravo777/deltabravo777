- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @deltabravo777

- I have a blog where I share my thoughts and some music I came across. It's baespeaks.com. 
  Website maintainance and creation has been quite some fun, to which I plan on further developing my expertise in coding.
  Outside websites I enjoy playing Starcraft in my free time and at the time of writing this I am ranked Diamond 1v1 and 4v4.
  
- Languages and Frameworks:
> C# (including Generics, Asynchronous Programming, LINQ, Serialization, Streams, Reactive Extensions and Events),
 HTML / CSS / Bootstrap 5 / JS,
 ASP.NET / SQL / Razor

- I have spent time working on a few projects if that interests you
